# JSGameTemplate

This project exists as a simple basis for basic canvas-based projects I aim to carry out in the future. It is based on
the code written for a project from my degree, [JSDiver](https://github.com/LukePJ25/JSDiver).

It is essentially the same source code, but with a few functions cleaned-up/moved around, and game-specific logic
removed to create a simple bare-bones game-loop system.

I will eventually write a small guide on how to use the included features, but here is a brief summary of what's
included:

- Basic game-loop cycle with configurable framerate.
- Separation of drawing and game-logic functionality.
- Simple debug menu for printing variables to the canvas.
- Simple math functions for calculating things like overlapping shapes, clamping values between boundaries, etc.

This will hopefully be expanded on as I use it more in the future. I don't exactly intend for this to be used outside
my own projects purely because it's not written for that purpose, but if you would like to use/amend some of this code
feel free to.
